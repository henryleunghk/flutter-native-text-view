# Native Text View for Flutter

A text view widget built using the native `UITextView` on iOS (this package only supports iOS for now). For text input, please refer to [flutter-native-text-input](https://github.com/henryleunghk/flutter-native-text-input).

## Installation

Follow the instructions from https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_text_view/install

## Why you should use this

Mobile app users are used to the convenience features for text selection provided by the native system. Even though Flutter provides a lot of useful widgets, Flutter developers may notice that `SelectableText` provided by Flutter are not on par with their native counterpart. Some actions are missing.
